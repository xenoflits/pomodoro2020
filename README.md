This is my first project for the #100daysofcode challenge
A pomodoro timer with user stories:

-I can set 25m 10m of 5m with a button
-I can start and pauze the timer with a button
-The timer will count down till 0, then make a beeping sound when finished
-A slider to change to dark mode

other rules:
use reactjs
mobile first
